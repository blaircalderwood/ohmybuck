## Next steps

I've listed resources below. I'm assuming a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and some comfort with node.\
Feel free to fast forward through any of the videos if you're happy with the concepts they're discussing.**Nodejs**\
If you have nodejs already installed - no worries. If not, please use nvm or nvm-windows. If you are using WSL, use nvm (instead of nvm-windows)\
*Why?* nvm allows you to switch to an updated or backdated version (in case you need to support a legacy application, or update to a new library).\
<https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>\
<https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows>I would always suggest using visual studio code as it allows us to all keep our development environments the same. Also if we have to pair or ask help, it makes it easier to assist each other. Also you'll find the extensions and development tools available really improve your workflows.**React Dev tools for Chrome**\
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en>**Redux Dev tools for Chrome**\
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en>**Introduction to Typescript**\
*What?* In short Typescript is a tool that applies types to javascript. This offers a range of advantages like maintainability of code, and it also allows us to safely program in a functional manner.\
<https://scrimba.com/g/gintrototypescript>**Typescript cheatsheet**\
*Why?* Just in case you need to recap anything ;)\
<https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/typescript/>**Quick dive into React**\
\_What?\_This is a quick overview of react and concepts in it\
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A>**A Deeper Dive into React** (I would only suggest this if you battle with the concepts in the video above)\
... I expect you to ask me questions about the above video before I send you a link for this as it's 5 hours long.**React with Typescript**\
*Why?* React coupled with Typescript go hand in hand. They help us program in a functional manner, which reduces the amount of code we write, which is ultimately simpler for us to maintain.\
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_C2X1yRRac>**React Hooks documentation**\
*Why?* By using classes, we introduce uncontrolled state in components - which is not good for functional programming. Hooks isolate those mutations and offer a significant reduction in complexity, in comparison to class based components.\
<https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>**React hooks with Typescript**\
*What?* Typescript help us to program in a functional paradigm, however react classes reduce that. This ties hooks with React.\
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQZJxyMoLws>**A React + Typescript + Material UI form tutorial**\
*What?* A quick project implementing all the tech listed above.\
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VmVYi9yrAA>**Introduction to Redux**\
*What?* Redux is used to manage the state in our application.\
*Why?* It allows us to centralize the data, reduce the requests to the server, and increase the responsivity of the application for the user. It also helps stop complexity of the passing of data from component to sub-component to sub-components via props.\
