Tooling for running local proxy services and url rewrites.

I've put together a repo for reverse proxying a domain to a local machine. Used for local testing of DNS resolving, and routing. Particularly useful for CMS migration projects.

[See the Local-Reverse-Proxy repo here](https://github.com/olmesm/Local-Reverse-Proxy)

## Use Cases

- multiple services on multiple ports, behind a single domain
- testing route-by-route service migrations with legacy service fallback
