Tools I use often:

https://github.com/kognise/water.css
Classless stylesheet (created by a 13yr old)

https://parceljs.org/
Zero config bundler

https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro
Micro node server

https://www.npmjs.com/package/surge
Static website hosting that just works - good with SPAâ€™s and virtual routes, also static JSON file hosting.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve
Lightweight zero config static server with hot reloading

https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server
Not as lightweight, but I offers a little more config than serve, and (i think) does JSON hosting, also does request proxying - get around those CORS challenges

https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink
React for interactive command-line apps

https://css-tricks.com/new-site-html-ipsum/
HTML kitchen sink

https://www.docz.site/
Zero config document frontend

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/nginx
The easiest way to configure a performant, secure, and stable NGINX server.
